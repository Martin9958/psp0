# INTRODUCTION TO COMPLEX SYSTEMS - Assignment Kit
### Laboratory Requirement
Using maven and git, a program is created to calculate the mean and the standard deviation of a set of n real numbers in a file, using a linked list implementation to store the n numbers for the calculations.

### Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes:
- Install into the maven repo: `$ mvn install`
- Compiling the project: `$ mvn clean compile`
- Create the .jar: `$ mvn package`
- Run the application `$ java -cp target/ps0-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar edu.escuelaing.arem.App `
- Generate the javadoc: `$ mvn javadoc:javadoc`

### Prerequisites
- Java 1.8
- Apache Maven 3.6.0
